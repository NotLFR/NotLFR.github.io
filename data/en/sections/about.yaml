  # a summary about you
summary: 'Working in a NOC for ~3 years has taught me the importance of real-time problem solving, clear and direct lines of communication, and staying calm under pressure. I have developed a deeper understanding of Network infrastructure, Systems Monitoring, IR, and Root Cause Analysis. Being part of a 24/7 support team has sharpened my ability to prioritize tasks, collaborate across tiers of departments, & maintain a high level of situational awareness. This has also shown me how important uptime, security, and proactive monitoring are in keeping our services running smoothly. Overall my NOC experience has give me both the technical skills, and the mindset to handle complex challenges effectively, and effeciently.'
